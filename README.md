# Data-Centric Biological Design and Engineering Turing Interest Group

This is the home of the Data-Centric Biological Design and Engineering Turing Interest Group (TIG) hosted by the Alan Turing Institute. This organisation hosts the TIGs unofficial website and is used to capture code generated as part of organised events and hack-a-thons.
